Goal

Replace CLAUDE.md with a symlink that points to AGENTS.md, so both files always share the same content.

Iteration 2

? system (+3s / 3s)

I need to replace CLAUDE.md with a symlink to AGENTS.md. Let me first check the current state of both files. (+4s / 7s) [6.5%]

→ Bash command="ls -la CLAUDE.md AGENTS.md", description="Check if CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md exist and th..." (+1s / 8s)

→ Read file_path=/home/ai4mgreenly/.local/state/ralph/clones/a... (+0s / 9s)

← Read type=text, file={"filePath":"/home/ai4mgreenly/.local/state/r... (+0s / 9s)

← Bash stdout="-rw-rw-r-- 1 ai4mgreenly ai4mgreenly 5991 Feb...", stderr=, interrupted=false, isImage=false (+0s / 10s)

→ Read file_path=/home/ai4mgreenly/.local/state/ralph/clones/a... (+0s / 10s)

← Read type=text, file={"filePath":"/home/ai4mgreenly/.local/state/r... (+0s / 10s)

Both files exist as regular files. AGENTS.md has the comprehensive content (5991 bytes) while CLAUDE.md has the older short version (1194 bytes). I'll now replace CLAUDE.md with a symlink pointing to AGENTS.md. (+5s / 15s) [8.1%]

→ Bash command="rm CLAUDE.md && ln -s AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md", description="Remove CLAUDE.md and create symlink to AGENTS.md" (+0s / 16s)

← Bash stdout=, stderr=, interrupted=false, isImage=false (+0s / 16s)

Now let me verify the symlink was created correctly by running the acceptance criteria tests. (+3s / 20s) [8.3%]

→ Bash command="readlink CLAUDE.md", description="Verify readlink outputs AGENTS.md" (+0s / 21s)

← Bash stdout=AGENTS.md, stderr=, interrupted=false, isImage=false (+0s / 21s)

→ Bash command="test -L CLAUDE.md && echo "CLAUDE.md is a sym...", description="Verify CLAUDE.md is a symlink" (+0s / 21s)

→ Bash command="diff CLAUDE.md AGENTS.md && echo "No differen...", description="Verify CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md have identical..." (+0s / 22s)

→ Bash command="ls -la CLAUDE.md AGENTS.md", description="Show final file listing to confirm symlink" (+0s / 23s)

← Bash stdout="CLAUDE.md is a symlink", stderr=, interrupted=false, isImage=false (+0s / 24s)

← Bash stdout="No differences found", stderr=, interrupted=false, isImage=false (+0s / 24s)

← Bash stdout="-rw-rw-r-- 1 ai4mgreenly ai4mgreenly 5991 Feb...", stderr=, interrupted=false, isImage=false (+0s / 24s)

Perfect! All acceptance criteria are met:

✓ `readlink CLAUDE.md` outputs `AGENTS.md`  
✓ `test -L CLAUDE.md` succeeds (CLAUDE.md is a symlink)  
✓ `diff CLAUDE.md AGENTS.md` shows no differences

The symlink uses a relative path (`AGENTS.md`) and points correctly. CLAUDE.md now mirrors AGENTS.md's content automatically. (+4s / 29s) [8.6%]

→ StructuredOutput summary=DONE (+0s / 29s)

← StructuredOutput  (+0s / 29s)


✓ DONE
