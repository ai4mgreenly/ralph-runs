Model: sonnet | Reasoning: med | Max Duration: unlimited

Goal

Rewrite the claude invocation in `generate_pr_description` to match the working pattern used in `scripts/ralph/run`'s `invoke_claude` method. The current implementation uses `Open3.capture3` with an array command, which doesn't work. The existing codebase uses a shell command string with `IO.popen`.
