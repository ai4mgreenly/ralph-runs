Braindead agentic loop. Just keep trying until it works.

Params

Model: sonnet | Reasoning: med | Max Duration: unlimited

Goal

Stop writing any runtime files into repo clones. Currently ralph-runs writes goal files, progress files, summary files, and ralph logs into `clone_dir/.pipeline/cache/`, which pollutes the repo's working copy and causes merge conflicts in PRs. Move all of these to `RALPH_DIR/goals/<goal_id>/` instead.
