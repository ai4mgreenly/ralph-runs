Create a file called `PING.md` at the root of the repository with the content `PONG`.

Iteration 1

Dirty working copy detected and committed, use `jj diff -r snrtrqysuykw` to see the changes.

Iteration 2

? system (+3s / 3s)

I'll complete this simple goal by creating the `PING.md` file at the repository root with the content `PONG`.

Let me first check if the file already exists, then create it. (+6s / 9s) [6.5%]

→ Bash command="ls -la PING.md 2>&1 || echo "File does not ex...", description="Check if PING.md already exists" (+0s / 10s)

← Bash stdout="ls: cannot access 'PING.md': No such file or ...", stderr=, interrupted=false, isImage=false (+0s / 11s)

→ Write file_path=/home/ai4mgreenly/.local/state/ralph/clones/a..., content=PONG (+2s / 13s)

← Write type=create, filePath=/home/ai4mgreenly/.local/state/ralph/clones/a..., content=PONG, structuredPatch=[], originalFile= (+0s / 14s)

→ Read file_path=/home/ai4mgreenly/.local/state/ralph/clones/a... (+2s / 16s)

← Read type=text, file={"filePath":"/home/ai4mgreenly/.local/state/r... (+0s / 16s)

Perfect! I've successfully created the `PING.md` file at the repository root with the exact content `PONG`. Both acceptance criteria are met. (+3s / 19s) [6.9%]

→ StructuredOutput summary=DONE (+0s / 19s)

← StructuredOutput  (+0s / 19s)
