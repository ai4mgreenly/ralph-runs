RALPH v0.4.0

Braindead agentic loop. Just keep trying until it works.

Params

Model: sonnet | Reasoning: med | Max Duration: unlimited

Goal

The `generate_pr_description` function invokes `claude -p` without clearing `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, which is inconsistent with how claude is invoked everywhere else in the codebase. Add `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=` (empty) to the environment so it uses the system credential.
