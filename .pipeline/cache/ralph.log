Goal

Add AI-generated pull request descriptions to the orchestrator. When `create_pr_from_clone` creates a PR, it should first make a dedicated Claude call (Haiku model) that takes the goal body and all progress entries as context and produces a concise PR description describing the final result.

Currently the PR body is just `"Goal ##{goal_id}"`. Replace this with a generated description that tells reviewers what the PR delivers and why.
