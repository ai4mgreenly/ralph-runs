Goal

Delete the file `PING.md` and create a new file `PONG.md` at the root of the repository with the content `PING`.

Iteration 1

Dirty working copy detected and committed, use `jj diff -r qpyyxvrulvvy` to see the changes.

Iteration 2

? system (+3s / 3s)

I'll execute the goal by checking the current state, deleting `PING.md`, and creating `PONG.md` with the content `PING`. (+8s / 11s) [6.5%]

→ Glob pattern=*.md, path=. (+0s / 12s)

← Glob filenames=["/home/ai4mgreenly/.local/state/ralph/clones..., durationMs=174, numFiles=10, truncated=false (+0s / 12s)

I found `PING.md` at the root. Now I'll delete it and create `PONG.md` with the content `PING`. (+2s / 15s) [6.9%]

→ Bash command="rm PING.md", description="Delete PING.md file" (+0s / 15s)

→ Write file_path=/home/ai4mgreenly/.local/state/ralph/clones/a..., content=PING (+0s / 16s)

← Bash stdout=, stderr=, interrupted=false, isImage=false (+0s / 16s)

← Write type=create, filePath=/home/ai4mgreenly/.local/state/ralph/clones/a..., content=PING, structuredPatch=[], originalFile= (+0s / 16s)

Now I'll verify the acceptance criteria are met. (+5s / 22s) [7.1%]

→ Bash command="ls -la PING.md 2>&1 || echo "PING.md does not...", description="Verify PING.md does not exist" (+0s / 23s)

← Bash stdout="ls: cannot access 'PING.md': No such file or ...", stderr=, interrupted=false, isImage=false (+0s / 24s)

→ Read file_path=/home/ai4mgreenly/.local/state/ralph/clones/a... (+0s / 24s)

← Read type=text, file={"filePath":"/home/ai4mgreenly/.local/state/r... (+0s / 24s)

Perfect! All acceptance criteria have been met:
- ✓ `PING.md` does not exist
- ✓ `PONG.md` exists at repo root
- ✓ `PONG.md` contains exactly `PING` (+5s / 29s) [7.3%]

→ StructuredOutput summary=DONE (+0s / 30s)

← StructuredOutput  (+0s / 30s)


✓ DONE
