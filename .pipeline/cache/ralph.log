Goal

Create a file named PING.md in the root of the repository with the contents pong.

Iteration 1

Dirty working copy detected and committed, use `jj diff -r prusnlmnmzrq` to see the changes.

Iteration 2

? system (+3s / 3s)

I need to check if PING.md was already created in the previous iteration and verify its contents. (+11s / 15s) [6.5%]

→ Read file_path=/home/ai4mgreenly/.local/state/ralph/clones/a... (+1s / 16s)

← Read type=text, file={"filePath":"/home/ai4mgreenly/.local/state/r... (+0s / 16s)

The file exists but contains "PONG" (uppercase) instead of "pong" (lowercase). I need to fix this. (+3s / 19s) [6.7%]

→ Edit replace_all=false, file_path=/home/ai4mgreenly/.local/state/ralph/clones/a..., old_string=PONG, new_string=pong (+0s / 20s)

← Edit filePath=/home/ai4mgreenly/.local/state/ralph/clones/a..., oldString=PONG, newString=pong, originalFile=PONG, structuredPatch=[{"oldStart":1,"oldLines":1,"newStart":1,"new..., userModified=false, replaceAll=false (+0s / 20s)

→ Read file_path=/home/ai4mgreenly/.local/state/ralph/clones/a... (+2s / 23s)

← Read type=text, file={"filePath":"/home/ai4mgreenly/.local/state/r... (+0s / 23s)

Perfect! The file PING.md now contains exactly "pong" as required. The goal is complete. (+4s / 27s) [7.0%]
