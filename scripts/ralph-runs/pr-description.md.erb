You are generating a pull request description for code review.

## Goal

<%= goal %>

## Progress History
<% progress_entries.each_with_index do |entry, idx| %>

### Iteration <%= idx + 1 %>
<%= entry %>
<% end %>

## Task

Write a concise PR description that tells a reviewer what this PR delivers and why. Describe the **FINAL RESULT** — what the code does now — not a history of how you got there.

## Format

- **Summary**: 2-3 sentences describing what the PR adds/changes and why
- **Key changes**: Short bullet list (3-5 items) of the main technical changes
- **No boilerplate**: No empty sections, no "N/A", no headers like "## Summary" or "## Changes"
- **Developer voice**: Write as if you're describing your own PR to a reviewer

## Example

Good description:

```
Adds AI-generated PR descriptions to the orchestrator. Instead of bare
"Goal #N" bodies, PRs now get a Haiku-generated summary describing what
the PR delivers and why, based on the goal and iteration progress.

- New ERB template for PR description prompt
- `generate_pr_description` function reads goal + progress, calls Haiku
- `create_pr_from_clone` uses generated body with fallback to "Goal #N"
```

## Output

Return only the PR description text. Do not include markdown code fences or any wrapper formatting.
